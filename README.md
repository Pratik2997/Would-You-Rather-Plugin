# Would-You-Rather-Plugin
The famous "would you rather" choices game for WordPress

One issue that I am working on and will fix:

Issue #1: Users have to manually give a unique id to each would you rather block in order for it function. I'm working on solving it by adding a random unique ID
for each block as soon as it is created.
