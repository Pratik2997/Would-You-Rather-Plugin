# Would-You-Rather-Plugin
The famous "would you rather" choices game for WordPress

Some issues that I am working on and will fix:

Issue #1: Users have to manually give a unique id to each would you rather block in order for it function. I'm working on solving it by adding a random unique ID
for each block as soon as it is created.

Issue #2: Not an issue if issue #1 is fixed => There is no validation/check whether the user input ID for the block is unique.

Note: WordPress doesn't have a method to give randomly assigned unique IDs to every block in the backend, which is why these issues have arisen.
